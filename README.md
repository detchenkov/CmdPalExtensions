# Mike's Big Command Palette Extension Bundle

This repo is a collection of extensions for the Windows Command Palette. Most of
these are goof-around projects for me, just to see if it is possible. 

These are open for community contributions. I definitely don't have the time to flush out the features of all these myself, but I'm happy to accept PRs.
